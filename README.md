### HURDAT2 ACE Calculator
This is a personal project to practice coding in Perl, which simply reads NOAA's Hurricane Research Division's HURDAT2 database with a locally saved file, and outputs the calculated accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for either a full hurricane season or specific storm. The program runs exclusively within the command-line.

For now, only seasonal ACE calculation is possible, and the year must be manually adjusted within the main.pl file provided; this will be changed in the future such that the user can input a year into the command-line, and the program will output its respective ACE.
