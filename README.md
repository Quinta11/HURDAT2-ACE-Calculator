# HURDAT2 ACE Calculator
This is a personal project to practice coding in Perl, which simply reads NOAA's Hurricane Research Division's HURDAT2 database with a locally saved file, and outputs the calculated accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for either a full hurricane season or specific storm. The program runs exclusively within the command-line.

The program guides the user along with various prompts leading up to the final ACE calculation. First, the user can specify which western hemisphere basin to use: the North Atlantic or Eastern Pacific. The user can then choose whether to calculate the ACE for a season in full, or to calculate the ACE of a specific storm within said season; this is done by first selecting the year, and then either typing the keyword "full" or the name of the desired storm.
